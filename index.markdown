As much as programming has this aura of geekery and math guys with pocket protectors (ok, that might be a bit dated), its really more about problem solving in much the same way as any other job.

And in my opinion, it’s an art form as well. There can be an elegance to a solution, there can also be some “hit it with a hammer” problem solving as well, and both can have their place.

We all use programs every day. A recipe is a program, a blueprint is a program. They are all just instructions that can be repeated over and over to come to the same results, or accomplish a repetitive task.

Join me here, and on YouTube as I try to help _you_ demystify coding.
