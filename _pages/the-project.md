Let's face it, most of you, if you are going to do anything for a site, or coding, it's going to be a blog.  And most likely a WordPress blog.

Being Canadian, one thing I know a little about is Hockey, so what we'll do for our project is launch a WordPress site, with a custom widget that we'll code.

It will display your favourite team's next scheduled game.

Nothing too complicated, we'll follow the KISS principle (keep it simple stupid), but we can add more and more complexity over time.

We'll start even simpler than that though, by writing a small script we can run to list out all the teams and their unique identifiers.

And even before that! We'll write a small script to demonstrate what code even is!

And a couple concepts/constructs we'll need to know.

Before we can begin, you will need to install somethings. Head over to the [prerequisites](/prerequisites/) page for more info.
