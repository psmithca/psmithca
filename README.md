- 👋 Hi, I’m Peter Smith. @psmithca

As you can probably guess, I’m a programmer.  Some would say a software engineer, or a developer.

Personally, I’ve always called myself a programmer, and I’ve been doing this game off and on since the 1980s, and fulltime in the industry for 25 years plus, both coding, and teaching.

I may be atypical in some ways, I grew up in rural Newfoundland, and spent most of my times split between sports and outdoor activities and curled upside inside reading a book.

Perhaps my love of Science Fiction and Fantasy inspired my desire to learn about computers.  

I’ve learned a lot, and discover even more by trying to educate others.  It makes you re-think how you grasp things, how to explain them, and gives you even new insight on what it is you work with.

Programming has always been the domain of the geek, but it shouldn’t be.  While in the past it was cryptic, it was always about problem solving, and we all use programs every day.  We just call them recipes, or blueprints, or plans.

Hopefully I can use my YouTube channel, blog and this space to demystify programming, and even if one person goes “Ah”, I’ll be happy.
